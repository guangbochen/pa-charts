# nginx

[nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) is an nginx deployment app for Kubernetes.

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps an nginx deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

The command deploys nginx on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.
